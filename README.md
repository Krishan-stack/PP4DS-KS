### By Massimiliano Izzo & Nicholas Day

Materials for [Python Programming for Data Science WOW Course](https://www.conted.ox.ac.uk/courses/python-programming-for-data-science-part-1?code=O21P656COW) - **this page will be updated as the course progresses**.

The class workspace on **Slack** is https://pp4ds-ox.slack.com. I encourage you to ask questions should you have them in the Slack channel incase your classmates can help. Nick (your tutor; nick.day@conted.ox.ac.uk) will also check Slack and provide support where possible. Download Slack from: https://slack.com/get

If you do not wish to use slack you can use Canvas to contact me and other students. 

To use **Jupyter** yourself, I recommend you download and install **Anaconda**, a Python Data Science Platform, from: [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) Make sure you download the **Python 3** version of Anaconda, ideally Python 3.8. You can also install Jupyter if you have a standard Python distribution installed. Ask your tutors for assistance if you need to install Jupyter on your own machine.

To get the contents of this repository I recommend that you install **Git SCM**, a source code management software, that will help you keep up-to-date with the repository. I will be adding content as the course progresses and Git will allow you to pull new material as it becomes available.

You can also run online live versions of the notebooks that are launched by **[Binder](https://mybinder.org)** by clicking on the `binder` buttons below without having to install anything yourself. Please note that Binder is still in beta testing and is hosted by *University of California, Berkeley* so may occasionally not work as expected (but is quite reliable). 

### Cloning this repository to use it offline

Click on the green 'Code' buttone at the top right of this page, then you could either open this in an IDE such as Visual Studio Code, or clone via GitHub Desktop. Either way, cloning will create a local copy of this directory on your machine.

If you want to run the notebooks on your own computer at home, apart from installing Jupyter/Anaconda as per above, you will need to install **Git**, which is a source code management software, from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Windows users can also get Git here: https://gitforwindows.org/. Once installed, you need to open up the command-line ("Command Prompt" on Windows or "Terminal" on Mac OSX) to run some commands.
