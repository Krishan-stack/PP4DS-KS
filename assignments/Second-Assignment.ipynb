    "**Rules.** Don't share your code with anybody. You are welcome to discuss questions with other students, but don't share the answers. Each correct answer will be worth 2.5 points, for a total of 50 points out of 20 questions. Part 2 awards 50 points out of the 100 maximum points of the assignment. The personal project, which is part 3 of the assignment portfolio will account for the remaining 30 points.\n",

Please feel free to ask each other questions and discuss approaches, even if you're not in the same physical classroom. The tutor will be available to answer general questions too, so please **do not hesitate** to ask questions even after the last week of term. \n",

    "**Advice.** Develop your answers incrementally. To perform a complicated table manipulation, break it up into steps, perform each step on a different line, give a new name to each result, and check that each intermediate result is what you expect. You can add any additional names or functions you want to the provided cells. \n",
